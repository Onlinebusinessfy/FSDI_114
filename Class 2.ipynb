   "source": [
    "## Definitions and Use Cases\n",
    "a. Define what a stack is and provide at least two real-world examples where stacks are used.\n",
    "A stack is a linear data structure that works based in the LIFO principle, which means First In, First Out. \n",
    "Examples: We can find it when we open a pringles can, because the last one to be put in is the first to go out and be eaten. Another example is when we wash plates and order it in a pile, the last result in the top and is the first to be out.\n",
    "b. Define what a queue is and provide at least two real-world examples where queues are used.\n",
    "A queue is a linear data structure that is based on the principle Fifo, which means First In, First Out.\n",
    "Examples: When we are making line at the supermarket, the first person to arrive is the first to be attended. Another example would be when you make a queue at the printer, because the first file to be sended is the first to be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Operations\n",
    "a. List and explain the primary operations performed on a stack.\n",
    "The primary operations that are performed on a stack is the Push that adds an element to the top of the stack, the Pop that removes and returns the top element of the stack, the peek that returns the top element without removing it, the IsEmpty that checks if the stack is empty and the IsFull that checks if the stack has reached its maximum capacity.\n",
    "b. List and explain the primary operations performed on a queue.\n",
    "The primery operations performed on a queue is the enqueue that adds an element to the end of the queue, the dequeue that removes and returns the element at the front of the queue, the peek that returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it, IsEmpty that checks if the queue is empty and the IsFull that checks if the queue has reached its maximum capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "Compare and contrast the behavior of stacks and queues in terms of their insertion and removal mechanisms. Use examples to illustrate your explanation.\n",
    "For insertion in the stack the elements are added to the top of the stack, whil for the queue they are added to the rear. For the removal, the stack removes elements from the top of the stack, while the queue removes te from the front. An example for stack is when in your browser you visit Page 1, which is inserted to the stack; Page 2, that is also push onto the stack; but, if you pop it would remove the page 2 and return it. In the queue a printer might queue document 1, document 2, document 3; so it would start printing based on the order it was given first, making it print the document 1, document 2 and document 3 in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations\n",
    "Research and describe at least one variation of a stack (e.g., bounded stack) and one variation of a queue (e.g., circular queue). Explain how they differ from the basic versions.\n",
    "A bounded stack is a stack with fixed maximum size or capacity. Once the stack reaches its capacity, no further elements can be added until an element is removed. It differs from a Basic Stack because it does not impose a size limit unless explicitly implemented. In contrast, a bounded stack enforces a constraint, potentially leading to a stack overflow error if an attempt is made to push beyond the capacity. \n",
    "The Circular Queue is a type of queue where the last position connects back to the first position, forming a circle. This structure allows the queue to reuse memory efficiently when elements are dequeued. It defers from Basic Queue because elements are added to the rear and removed from the front, but it can leave unused memory at the front once elements are dequeued, and a circular queue overcomes this by reusing the vacated space, ensuring the queue behaves as if it wraps around.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "a. Write pseudocode or explain how a stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list.\n",
    "A stack can be implemented in both ways, but it's important to keep in mind that the array has a fixed size that requires preallocated memory, for the insertion/delition are simple and occur at the end of the array, making it easier to implement but less flexible. Talking about the linked list, it's dynamically allocated which can grow or shrink as needed, in the insertion/delition are more efficient since they involve pointer updates and it's slightly more complex but more memory-efficient.\n",
    "b. Write pseudocode or explain how a queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list.\n",
    "The array, as well in the queue has a fixed and requires a preallocated memory, adding elements occurs at the rear, while removing them occurs at the front. This often requires shifting elements after a dequeue operation, making it less efficient as the queue grows. However, it is easier to implement and works as well for small queues.\n",
    "For the linked list, it's also Dynamically allocated, it can grow or shrink without size limitations. Enqueue and dequeue operations are more efficient, as they only involve pointer updates without requiring element shifting. This makes it a better choice for queues with varying sizes but requires slightly more complex implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "Discuss the time complexity of common operations (e.g., push, pop, enqueue, dequeue) for stacks and queues. Explain any differences you observe.\n",
    "The time complexity of operations depends on the underlying implementation (array or linked list) and the operation itself.\n",
    "For stacks there are not big differences between array-based and linked list-based. Both offer a 0(1) complexity.\n",
    "For dequeue it can take 0(n) if elements needs to be shifted after removing the front element, making it less efficient than circular queue or a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "Compare how stacks and queues are used in computer science, specifically in areas like memory management, process scheduling, or data buffering.\n",
    "Stacks and queues are fundamental in data structures in computer science, each suited to specific scenarios due to their different mechanisms of insertion and removal. In memory management the stack in each function call pushes a new stack frame onto the stack and the queue when there are garbage collection algorithms, queues may be used to track objects that need to be checked for reachability. In process scheduling the stack: each thread has its own stack to store the current state this helps swithc between threads effectively, the queue is used to cycle through processes, giving each one a time slice. For data buffering a stack its sometimes used in text editors for undo operations, this actions are pushed onto the stack and the last action is undone when popped, while the queue the data is enqueued as it arrives and dequeued in the same order for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reversing a Queue with a Stack\n",
    "Explain how you can use a stack to reverse the order of elements in a queue. Provide a step-by-step description or pseudocode.\n",
    "To reverse the order of elements in a queue using a stack, it might be optimal to follow the sistematic approach that leverages the LIFO nature of the stack.\n",

    "Queue contains: queue = [4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "Step 4: Queue is now reversed\n",
    "\n",
    "The queue now contains the elements in reversed order: [4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure Selection\n",
    "Given the following scenarios, decide whether a stack or queue would be more appropriate and justify your answer:\n",
    "a. Undo functionality in a text editor.\n",
    "For undoing a functionality in a text editor, the stack will be the most appropiate because every action that the user makes will be pushed onto the stack so when the user wants to undo something it would popped the last element from the stack and reversed.\n",
    "b. Managing tasks in a printerâ€™s job queue.\n",
    "For the printer it would be most likely to use the queue because the first document send to it is the one that needs to be printed first, and that why the prinet is creating a queue based in which documents arrives first.\n",
    "c. Depth-first traversal of a graph.\n",
    "The stack would be use in this case, because it invlolves exploring a branch as deeply as possible before backtracking. So Nodes are pushed onto the stack as they are visited, and when backtrackin is required the last visited node is popped from the stack.\n",
    "d. First-come, first-served customer service.\n",
    "In this case for sure it's the queue, because based on the principle FIFO the first person to arrive is the first person to be served.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Concepts\n",
    "Research and explain what a deque (double-ended queue) is. How does it differ from a standard queue and a stack? Provide at least one example of its practical use.\n",
    "A deque is a data structure that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends, it supports insertion and deletion of both the front and the rear. It combines the functionality of the queue and the stack. It differs from the queue and stack because it can use at the same time the principle LIFO and FIFO, which makes it insert and delete from the front or the rear of it. A really common example would be when having a Job Scheduling with Priority, because the tasks have different levels of priority, so they could be added at the front or rear based on the urgency."
